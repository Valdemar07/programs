This program is the game space invaders (you can google it if you want). The images in the directory are graphics and are kinda important so be sure to copy them into the same folder as the "Space invaders.py" file

Disclaimer:
You need python 3.8 or never (https://www.python.org/)
You also need the plugins: os, turtle, math and random
I would recommend downloading pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) because it will download the plugins automatically
