This program is a totally normal calculator and does nothing else than calculating what you tell it to calculate. Just make sure to only type in two numbers, one symbol and seperate them with a space (f.x. 2 + 4)

Disclaimer:
You need python 3.8 or never (https://www.python.org/)
I would recommend downloading pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
